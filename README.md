# How to Use it?

-  Once you have your Swift package set up, adding `CoreAPI` as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift` or the Package list in Xcode.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/obadasemary/BrandUseCase.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
```
